test:
	birth:
		category:
			number: 7

			unused: The value
			die:
				death


			lol # This is possible for now
			funny:
				assert false
				this doesn't get parsed anyway
			multiple:
				This is the first value
				This is the second value

			more multiple values: This one just has one value
				# This is not accounted for

	# In the code, it sets this variable to the 'number' option.
	assert {the_number} + 5 = 12

	# In the code, it sets this variable to the joined values
	assert {multiple} is equal to "This is the first value;This is the second value" with "{multiple} has not been set correctly: %{multiple}%"

	# The 'optional' option was not specified, so in the code, this variable should not be set
	assert {optional} is not set with "{optional} has been set when it shouldn't have been: %{optional}%"
